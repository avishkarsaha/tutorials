## 3. Basic CUDA Implementation

### Initial Implementation Strategy

Our initial CUDA implementation follows these key steps:
1. Process each row (sequence) in parallel using CUDA blocks
2. Use thread collaboration within a block to compute statistics
3. Apply the normalization with learned parameters

### Core Implementation

Let's examine the key components of our kernel:

```cuda
template<typename T>
__global__ void LayerNormKernel(
    const T* __restrict__ input,
    const T* __restrict__ weight,
    const T* __restrict__ bias,
    T* __restrict__ output,
    const int hidden_size,
    const float eps) {
    
    const int batch_idx = blockIdx.x;  // Each block handles one sequence
    const int tid = threadIdx.x;       // Thread ID within the block
```

Key design decisions:
1. Templated implementation to support both FP32 and FP16
2. Use of `__restrict__` to enable pointer aliasing optimizations
3. One CUDA block per sequence for maximum parallelism

### Integration with PyTorch

The C++ interface bridges our CUDA kernel with PyTorch:

```cpp
torch::Tensor layer_norm_forward(
    torch::Tensor input,
    torch::Tensor weight,
    torch::Tensor bias,
    float eps) {
    
    CHECK_INPUT(input);
    CHECK_INPUT(weight);
    CHECK_INPUT(bias);
    
    return layer_norm_cuda_forward(input, weight, bias, eps);
}
```

### Initial Benchmarking

Our benchmarking script tests various configurations:
- Batch sizes: 1, 8, 32, 128, 512
- Hidden sizes: 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096
- Data types: FP32 and FP16

Example baseline results (on NVIDIA L4):
```
Configuration     | PyTorch      | Custom       | Speedup
B=32  H=1024     | 0.042ms      | 0.035ms      | 1.20x
B=128 H=1024     | 0.156ms      | 0.128ms      | 1.22x
B=512 H=2048     | 1.248ms      | 0.982ms      | 1.27x
```

## 4. Optimization Journey

### 1. Memory Access Optimization

The first optimization focuses on memory access patterns:

```cuda
// Efficient memory access pattern
const T* row_input = input + batch_idx * hidden_size;
T* row_output = output + batch_idx * hidden_size;

// Coalesced memory loads
for(int i = tid; i < hidden_size; i += blockDim.x) {
    sum += static_cast<float>(row_input[i]);
}
```

Key improvements:
1. Coalesced memory access pattern
2. Pointer arithmetic to minimize address calculations
3. Strategic data loading to maximize L2 cache hit rate

### 2. Warp-Level Reduction Optimization

One of the most significant optimizations is the use of warp-level primitives:

```cuda
// Warp reduce using shuffle instructions
#pragma unroll
for(int offset = WARP_SIZE/2; offset > 0; offset /= 2) {
    sum += __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, sum, offset);
}
```

Benefits:
1. Eliminates shared memory for intra-warp communication
2. Reduces synchronization overhead
3. Maximizes instruction throughput

### 3. Two-Level Reduction Strategy

We implement a two-level reduction strategy:
1. Warp-level reduction using shuffle instructions
2. Block-level reduction using shared memory

```cuda
// First level: Warp reduction
if (lane_id == 0) {
    s_partial_sums[tid / WARP_SIZE] = sum;
}
__syncthreads();

// Second level: Block reduction
if (tid < WARP_SIZE) {
    #pragma unroll
    for(int offset = WARP_SIZE/2; offset > 0; offset /= 2) {
        sum += __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, sum, offset);
    }
}
```

### 4. Numeric Stability Optimization

We maintain numeric precision while handling different data types:

```cuda
// Use FP32 for intermediate computations
float variance = 0.0f;
for(int i = tid; i < hidden_size; i += blockDim.x) {
    float diff = static_cast<float>(row_input[i]) - s_mean;
    variance += diff * diff;
}
```

### Performance Results

After optimizations (compared to PyTorch's implementation):

```
Configuration     | PyTorch      | Optimized    | Speedup
B=32  H=1024     | 0.042ms      | 0.028ms      | 1.50x
B=128 H=1024     | 0.156ms      | 0.098ms      | 1.59x
B=512 H=2048     | 1.248ms      | 0.756ms      | 1.65x
```

Key performance improvements:
1. ~1.5-1.7x speedup across different configurations
2. Better scaling with larger batch sizes
3. Maintained numerical accuracy (max diff < 1e-6)
